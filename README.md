# Patients Readmission Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting patient readmissions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze patient data and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of readmission within a given timeframe.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains patient records, including features such as:
- Patient demographics
- Medical history
- Hospital visit details
- Previous readmission status

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering
   - Encoding categorical variables
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing key trends
   - Understanding correlations
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Applied multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dependencies
To run the notebook, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd your-repo
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Patients Readmission Prediction.ipynb"
```

## Results
The best-performing model achieved a significant improvement in readmission prediction, helping healthcare providers optimize patient care and resource allocation.
